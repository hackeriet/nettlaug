	<h2 class="featurette-heading">About Hackeriet's Nettlaug</h2>
	<p class="lead">
		Hackeriet has built a server room and is installing a fibre internet linkup. This means that we now can offer the sophisticated nerd an "anything goes" server at 100Mbps for a very reasonable price, --many times more affordable than any commercial provider out there.

	<p>
		Hackeriet gets a gigabit fibre line, peers with the free exchange FIXO and becomes an ISP! "We pay for this how?!" you might ask. With high availability comes great value: we can now host servers on our own fully operational Death Star. As a member you can install your server to do with as you please, to point The Ray at any target you should dream of.
	</p>

	<p>Don't have a server to put online? That's ok, we have some extra iron for no extra charge.</p>

	<p>
		This is a non-commercial venture, and the server rent is going towards covering the cost of the fibre line, power and infrastructure maintenance. SLA when it comes to uptime is Hackeriet's "best effort" and the EULA is reminiscent of "Kardemommeloven" (Don't know what that is? GGGGoogle it!). What this means is: members are a contributing factor to the networks stability and other members will help you only of their own volition and the goodness of their tiny cynical hearts.
